    help
        Select the PHY driver to use for the example.
        Note:
        Olimex EVB REV B IoT Board use LAN8710
        and can use the same config from LAN8720
        so here is no change need. we use LAN8720 config
        as default.

    bool "Microchip LAN8710 PHY"
    help
        Select this to use the Microchip LAN8720 / LAN8710  PHY

    default 0
    range 0 31
    help
        Select the PHY Address (0-31) for the hardware configuration and PHY model.
        Note:
        Olimex EVB REV B IoT Board use PHY Address 0 and is default

    help
        Use a GPIO "power pin" to power the PHY on/off during operation.
        Consult the example README for more details
        Olimex ESP32 EVB REV B IoT LAN8710 Board with CAN do not use this

config PHY_POWER_PIN
    int "PHY Power GPIO"
    default 17
    depends on PHY_USE_POWER_PIN
    help
        GPIO number to use for powering on/off the PHY.

config PHY_SMI_MDC_PIN
    int "SMI MDC Pin"
    default 23
    help
        GPIO number to use for SMI clock output MDC to PHY.
        Note:
        Olimex EVB REV B IoT Board use GPIO 23 as default

config PHY_SMI_MDIO_PIN
    int "SMI MDIO Pin"
    default 18
    help
       GPIO number to use for SMI data pin MDIO to/from PHY.
       Note:
       Olimex EVB REV B IoT Board use GPIO 18 as default
